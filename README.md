# Project: The Movie Database Analysis

> In this project, We will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.


## Introduction

> This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) from 1960 until 2015, including user ratings and revenue. In this project, we will go deeper into the dataset answering questions that will give us more fascinating findings. In particular, we'll be interested in finding what kinds of properties are associated with high revenue movies, which genres are most popular from year to year? and much more. The <a href="#eda">Exploratory Data Analysis</a> section will contain the rest of our analysis research questions which help us investigating this dataset.
